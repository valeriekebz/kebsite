",7 Years,5 Years,"Financial competence
I have participated and been involved in the development and review of departmental budgets and resource mobilization strategies, with the most recent being the KEBS CB proposed budget for 2020 -2023. This has been an interesting experience especially since the earlier proposed budgets had been prepared under the assumption that QMS certification would remain as a deliverable under the performance contract and thus this would be a solid business avenue. When QMS certification was removed from the PC, we’ve considered various strategies on how to bridge the gap and one of the strategies was to increase ISMS certification. Financial competency is a critical skill to the success of KEBS in light of mitigating challenges, last year I managed to increase the number of ISMS certified clients and surpass my financial target by approximately 2.1 million shillings.
Performance Management competence
I am a member of the KEBS CB Performance Management committee which is tasked with reviewing the department’s monthly performance with regard to:
1.	Balance Scorecard performance 
2.	Meeting KPIs
3.	Achievement of service charter timelines
4.	Performance contract targets
5.	Reviewing of the effectiveness of controls in the risk register for both information security and risk management
6.	The implementation of corrections and corrective actions identified during internal audits and the accreditation assessments
As a head of section, it is my responsibility to prepare the sectional work plan, monthly, quarterly and annual reports, which then feed into the departmental reports that are developed by the above committee.
Additionally, I have been directly involved in the performance management at the KEBS CB by performing internal audits for ISO 17021, and I have recently taken over the role of Deputy Management Representative whose duties include:
1.	Ensuring the requirements of ISO 17021 are met and adhered to during the KEBS CB operations
